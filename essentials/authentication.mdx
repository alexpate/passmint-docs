## **API Endpoints**

All API requests should be made to our production API:

```bash
api.passmint.com;
```

---

## Authentication

In order to authenticate with the API, all requests must be made with your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header.

```bash
curl https://api.passmint.com/v1/passes \
  -H "X-Api-Key: sk_ABCD_1234"
```

### Rolling your API key

If you need to regenerate your API key, this can be done in your dashboard under "Settings".
