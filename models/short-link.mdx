Short links are one of our delivery methods. They are used to deliver passes to your customers. In essence, they are short URLs that redirect to a pass.

## Creating a Short Link

Short links are created automatically whenever you create a new pass. You can either find the short link on the "passes" page, or in the pass response object.

```json
{
  "id": "clpd23n5500037aktdqiknubi",
  "shortLink": "https://go.passmint.com/clpd0plpy00017akt1abricbu/apple"
}
```

## Re-generating a Short Link

Should you need to re-generate a short link, you can do so by clicking the "Regenerate" button on the short link page. This will generate a new short link for the pass. The old short link will no longer work.
