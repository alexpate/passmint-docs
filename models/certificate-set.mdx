Certificate sets are required to generate Apple Passbook passes. They are used to sign and encrypt the pass data. We have a default certificate set that you are able to use for testing purposes. However, you will need to create your own certificate set for production use.

## Creating a Certificate Set

New certificate sets can only be created in the dashboard. To create a new certificate set, navigate to the [**certificate sets page**](https://www.passkit.xyz/settings/certificates) and click the "Create new certificate set" button. There you will also find a guide on how to create one. Please note that you will need to have a valid Apple Developer account.

## Using a Certificate Set

When creating a new iOS pass template, you will be able to select your certificate set. If you have not created a certificate set yet, you will only be able to select the default certificate set.
